Stress is a good thing..

Some people argue stress (in _manageable_ amounts) is a good thing for our overall health and effectiveness because it can be a huge motivator. So think of it as our _bodily_ debt. Credit card debt is good when we can manage it. It's actually necessary in many cases to have it (sorry, Dave Ramsey) so long as we aren't drowning in it. It's better to keep multiple accounts open so long as they are responsibly managed and paid off on time. The same goes for stress in life. If it's a _manageable_ debt, we can use it to our advantage.

So what's the difference between _manageable stress_ and _non-manageable stress_? Well, part of it may be the sense of control. When we feel as if we are in control of our situation that is a manageable stress. 

For example, putting stress on the body during a strenuous workout is an example of a controlled stress. You feel the stress of that weight and you feel the ache in your muscles but you are in complete control. You could drop that weight and walk out the door at any moment.

An unmanageable source of stress might be from your noisy neighbors with the loud music and yappy dog while you have 3 deadlines piling up and 2 exams in the same week.

We as college students have no control over when our next exam or paper is due but there is a trick for feeling more in control.

It is all too easy to automatically see workload or schoolwork as a constraint or an unfortunate task that just needs to get completed and I think it is a good idea to start there. If you feel like college is useless but you question that instinct maybe gather guidance from someone you trust in your life who could change your mind for the better in any given direction. (For me, those fountains of wisdom stemmed from my older sisters. They both encouraged me at different points to pursue college even with all my glory and dreams of becoming an entrepreneur and freelance artist.) And true, I still to this day do not know the goal of my bachelor's degree. I know many people who can attest to the fact that they do not end up using their degree in their field of work. But I am honestly enjoying my studies and I try to find virtue from each of my teachers...usually this part doesn't take much effort! Once I get to know my professors, I feel attached to their style, their way of speaking, the content they bring, their subtle jokes, the stuff they mention and specifically tell us we don't need to know but I get interested all the more. I hope this is not a rare concept among my fellow colleagues to love our professors for what they can give us or express in individualistic ways. However, I will describe a time in my life where I felt like giving up on college. (More on this below.)

1. Change your mindset or find somebody you value and trust to steer you towards a meaningful goal. Let me say I am not opposed to those who choose something other than college. I think the importance is to realistically find what is best for you. As long as you're moving forward, you are doing amazing things! It is ultimately up to you do decide what that looks like. Being flooded with so much freedom and choice can feel overwhelming for those beginning stages of emerging adulthood because all our lives up to that point we knew schedules that were programed for us. And the trite saying, _anything is possible if you believe_ starts to ring more and more true with each passing year as we learn and grow.
2. This one is important. It is completely okay and completely acceptable to change your mind - about your degree, your school, your group of friends, your study habits, your long-term or short-term goals. According to the National Center of Educational Statistics, on average people change their degree plan 80% of the time. There is this misconception that changing one's mind means being unsteady, noncommittal, unfocused, or lost. None of which are true. Change your mind as often as you need to. This is not an uncommon concept. As shaky as the people around you may feel when you are making these changes, you can stand firm in knowing what is the best decision for you. I experienced this when I went to private art school, (Kansas City Art Institute) - I will say I have plenty of friends who continue to get their education here and are probably overworked and sleep-deprived but they are getting good things out of it. But it wasn't for me. I had to make that choice. And it was harder in the end on my family and friends than it was on me. They were scared I was losing myself, losing sight of what was important, being irresponsible, etc. But I knew I needed out. So keep well-meaning people in your life to continue to support you and steer you towards the goodness. They may not understand your situation the way you do but if they have the energy to get upset about you changing your mind, chances are they are invested in your future for a reason...maybe it's a selfish reason...or maybe it's because they really do want the best for you and they get afraid because they're human. In time, it will get easier to follow your decision. Let time heal change. Be proud of yourself! It takes courage to make a change from a specific plan you felt you were supposed to follow.
3. Now that the soul-searching is done, here are some more hands-on tips for studying that I find useful as reminders: 

\-Test yourself frequently.

\-Develop a sense for what you do Not know.

\-Is this long term information or short-term? Know how you will apply this knowledge and test accordingly.

\-Schedule & organize.

\-Spaced practice.

\-Interleaving.
