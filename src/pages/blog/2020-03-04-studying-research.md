Stress is a good thing..

Some people argue stress (in _manageable_ amounts) is a good thing for our overall health and effectiveness because it can be a motivator. So think of it as our bodily debt. Credit card debt is good when we can manage it. It's actually necessary in many cases to have it (sorry, Dave Ramsey) so long as we aren't drowning in debt. It's better to keep multiple accounts open so long as they are responsibly managed and paid off. The same goes for stress in life. If it's a _manageable_ debt, we can use it to our advantage.

So what's the difference between _manageable stress_ and _non-manageable stress_? Well, part of it may be control. When we feel as if we are in control of our situation that is a manageable stress. 

For example, putting stress on the body during a strenuous workout is an example of a controlled stress. 

An unmanageable source of stress might be from your noisy neighbors with the loud music and yappy dog. 

The reason I bring all of this nonsense up is because _in my mind_ (which is a dangerous place to travel) all of it correlates to studying. Some people will automatically see workload or schoolwork as a constraint or an unfortunate task that just needs to get completed and I think it is a good idea to start there. If you feel like college is useless but you question that instinct maybe gather guidance from someone you trust in your life who could change your mind for the better in any given direction. (For me, those fountains of wisdom stemmed from my older sisters. They both encouraged me at different points to pursue college even with all my glory and dreams of becoming an entrepreneur and freelance artist.) And it is true, I still to this day do not know the goal of my bachelor's degree. I know many people who can attest to the fact that they do not end up using their degree in their field of work. But I am honestly enjoying my studies and I try to find virtue from each of my teachers...usually this is pretty easy to do! I hope this is not a rare concept among my fellow colleagues. However, I will describe a time in my life where I felt like giving up on college. (More on this below.)

1. Change your mindset or find somebody you value and trust to steer you towards a meaningful goal. Let me say I am not opposed to those who choose something other than college. I think the importance is to realistically find what is best for you. As long as you're moving forward, you are doing amazing things! (It is ultimately up to you do decide what that looks like or what feels meaningful. And sometimes being flooded with so much freedom and choice can feel overwhelming for those beginning stages of emerging adulthood because all our lives up to that point we knew schedules that were programed for us, ex: school, sports, homework, friends, chores, maybe side jobs, get a car, experience dating, etc...The difference is once you become an adult and start paying your own bills, living outside your parent's control, being proactive about your own health or goals and schedule or in some cases quickly becoming in charge of little ones who now look up to you...this is where you are given endless possibilities and any emerging adult might not know what to do with that at first. That is completely okay.)
