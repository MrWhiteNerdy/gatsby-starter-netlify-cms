  These are unfamiliar times we are living in. I wanted to list a few things for
  myself that I can do to keep busy while kept indoors during my break and
  hopefully give someone else an idea or two on how to enjoy living indoors for
  these next few months or until further notice.

* Continue running - see how long you can go at 5.5 mph (continue to break your own record) *I may need to revise my running goals as I am far less motivated to go running now that the gym is closed. I can make an effort to go on more frequent walks outside, especially when the weather is nice
* create a schedule or routine that I'm happy with including times to wake up and go to bed
* Adopt a kitten *update: we did this one! - she is precious, her name is Peach. I'll share more about her later :)
* Paint
* Study for subjects that you're most interested in + take extensive notes/research
* Message and call friends
* Watch movies and tv shows
* Order in food
* Listen to plenty of music
* Crack open the windows and deep clean the apartment regularly 
* Check out online master classes and other free or affordable online classes being offered during this time
* Pamper myself with face masks, waxing, and spa treatments
* Find a good book
* Meditate and hangout near a sunny window
* Play games on the switch
