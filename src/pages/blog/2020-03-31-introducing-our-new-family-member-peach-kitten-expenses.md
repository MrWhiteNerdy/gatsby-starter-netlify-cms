  Here I will go over some of my favorite purchases for our baby kitten! I am so
  grateful to have the finances to afford her during these days while I'm stuck
  at home. She is a wonderful fur baby to comfort me, distract me, and love me.
  I highly recommend considering adoption if you can!

Some of these purchases can be made from any of your regularly shopped stores such as Walmart, Target, Petco, Petsmart, etc. And look around in unexpected places such as Aldi's or other grocery stores that might surprise you! Not all pet related items need to be specifically labeled for a pet in order to function properly. A great example of this are food dishes. I have a kitten and she has no issues with tipping the bowls over so I bought a couple of microwave save plastic kid bowls from Target to use as her canned cat food dishes (she likes the food warm - what a princess! lol) They cost me about a quarter each and they work great! Who needs a bowl specifically stated for cats when they are virtually the same thing! (minus maybe a slippage ring around the bottom if necessary)

I recently got into Chewy for some of their shipping deals (they have automated shipping for things such as food and cat litter just like Amazon which will help save you money long-term. In Chewy, you can change your automated shipping for many different items any time and there is high flexibility or the spacing of shipment - goes by weeks instead of months like most of Amazon automated purchases.)
