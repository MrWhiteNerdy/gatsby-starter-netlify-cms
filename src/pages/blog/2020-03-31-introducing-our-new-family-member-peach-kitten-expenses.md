  Here I will go over some of my favorite purchases for our baby kitten! I am so
  grateful to have the finances to afford her during these days while I'm stuck
  at home. She is a wonderful fur baby to comfort me, distract me, and love me.
  I highly recommend considering adoption if you can!

Some of these purchases can be made from any of your regularly shopped stores such as Walmart, Target, Petco, Petsmart, etc.  look around in unexpected places such as Aldi's or other grocery stores that might surprise you! Not all pet related items need to be specifically labeled for a pet in order to function properly. A great example of this are food dishes. I have a kitten and she has no issues with tipping the bowls over so I bought a couple of microwave save plastic kid bowls from Target to use as her canned cat food dishes (she likes the food warm - what a princess! lol) They cost me about a quarter each and they work great! Who needs a bowl specifically stated for cats when they are virtually the same thing! (minus maybe a slippage ring around the bottom if necessary)

I recently got into Chewy for some of their shipping deals (they have automated shipping for things such as food and cat litter just like Amazon which will help save you money long-term. In Chewy, you can change your automated shipping for many different items any time and there is high flexibility or the spacing of shipment - goes by weeks instead of months like most of Amazon automated purchases.)

Here are some items I highly recommend:

1. Litter genie (can be found in Walmart or Target as well as Petco and Amazon and Chewy) - about $20

This thing allows you to save on trips to the dump! Just as a human baby's diaper genie takes care of poo, so does a cat litter genie. It traps the smell inside and compacts it into one small space. All you have to do now is scoop it out of the litter and put it in the genie until it's full! Once it's full you can take the bag out of the genie and take it to the dump. It can hold it up to 8 weeks! Imagine the chore of having to go to the trash with your cat's feces eliminated to only once every couple months.

2. A simple litter box without a top/lid.

I learned this one the hard way. I bought both the one with and one without. I learned from the adoption center that cats are extremely clean creatures. They are also extremely sensitive to smells. Meaning being trapped inside the smell of their own feces is actually overwhelming to many cats. After I read this I decided to take the top off. If you're worried about the fall out of litter when they're playing in it or kicking it up, try finding a box with a height of at least 6 inches.

3. Litter without scent.

This one is often debated. I personally feel that I react with hives and itchiness to my cat's fur when I try using a highly perfumed cat litter. They often smell quite intense and while this will cover up bad smells, a non-scented cat litter will most often do the job just fine as well. 

4. Stella & Chewy cat food - personally recommended to me by my vet :)
