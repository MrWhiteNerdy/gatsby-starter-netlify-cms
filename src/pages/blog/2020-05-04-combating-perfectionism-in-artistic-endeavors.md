  The quest for perfection can inhibit anyone from moving forward. Artists have
  to be especially careful from critiquing themselves too harshly. Here I walk
  through some of my current struggles and hopeful messages with this subject.

Recently, I have taken the plunge in devoting my time and energy in creating a small business. 

You can check out my previous blog, "Starting a Small Business" which describes the goals I've made for myself along this process. In case you're curious my business will include lots of adorable polymer clay charms (think kawaii and miniatures!) :)

Creating any small business takes a lot of grit - time, devotion, energy, purpose.

I've learned from my psychology professor (this is an extremely dumbed down analysis - mind you), that if your career does not in some way give you satisfaction which includes a meaningful purpose (such as helping others) it can feel difficult to move forward.

This is something I have been giving a lot of thought lately. My business is not necessarily deep - it closely resembles a hobby or interest rather than helping others. However, I have devoted many hours in creating my charms to the point of wondering *what is it all for, really*? What is the deeper purpose or meaningful purpose for devoting so much of my time and energy into this business if I continue in this way?

Well, two solutions come to mind when I consider this.

1. I can create a new time schedule that better suits me and my life (which will allow for more time to focus on outside activities such as studying for school and spending quality time with family/friends). This would include setting a stricter bedtime schedule, allowing for more time to implement self-care and exercise, as well as defining what I need to have in my environment in order to feel motivated to create (e.g. sunlight,  background music, video to keep my company, or complete quiet).

2. Alternatively, I find an angle in this business that somehow connects my hobby with a deeper purpose. This may mean that over time, my business product or mission changes in some way. Right off the bat, I'm imagining an example of this may be something as simple as becoming a mentor to those who would like to learn to create polymer clay creations. This would fulfill a deeper purpose in me because I would be able to connect with others in an expression that feels meaningful to me in a more intimate setting.

These considerations are important. However, it dawned on me that so long as my interest in polymer clay continues to thrive it can grow and expand in an endless number of ways and I shouldn't concern myself too deeply in the beginning of my business with the fussiness of finding a deep-seated why.

I hope this is encouraging to anyone who may find themselves in a similar spot as a maker/creator/artist.

It can feel a bit stressful to prove to others why a specific niche or artistic endeavor feels satisfying to you. Try your best in whatever you do and remember that if you love what you do this will show in your work. I have to remind myself often that purpose is not always planned...meaning as I grow as a person, purpose can continue to grow as well.

I think it is wonderful to investigate my deeper belonging to my business. However, I hope to remember the fun and explorative process of creating. Maybe it is all quite simple and it can be as simple as wanting to create things that others find joy in!

Being an artist doesn't always have to be a life-giving occupation for others. However, if this appeals, I certainly value and respect these fields! One example of this would be the art therapy career path. 

In my experience, I have witnessed that all artists find it takes a great deal of sacrifice to continually acquire new skills and continue creating new things that the world may or may not approve of or admire. This also takes a great deal of inner-strength because art seemingly does not exist until it has an audience. But it has a right to exist on its own for the fundamental purpose of "self expression" and "adding something to this world." 

This is all starting to sound very poetic! And I believe creating is a form of poetry. It's beautiful to be an artist or a maker. 

I've heard before that the position of being an artist is unique because one cannot call themselves an artist. You must wait for *others* to call you an artist in order to be *deserving* of this label. I disagree.

I believe that you may call yourself an artist if that is truly what you want to be just in the same way you might call yourself a writer or a singer or a dancer if these are your passions. You do not need to over explain your passion to anybody because your "product", your mission, your goals, your values will speak for themselves. 

To sum up, I am proud of myself for sticking with my artistic goals. I am proud of anyone who does the same in their own fields. I hope you give yourself some love today in whatever purpose or goal you find yourself. Please comment or share this with anyone who may need some love today. I hope you all are doing well. 

Thanks for reading.
