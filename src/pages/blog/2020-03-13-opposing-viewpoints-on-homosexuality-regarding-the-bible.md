  Here I have gathered some evidence on a couple of opposing views regarding
  homosexuality, the people behind these beliefs, and a few of my questions
  after reading these articles and investigating further. I will also plainly
  state my beliefs and thoughts. Throughout, I hope to remain respectful.

This is the article I will be referencing further on as I discuss some of my thoughts. It is a wonderful discussion because it highlights two opposing viewpoints and in this way remains unbiased. In my mind, it simply offers the evidence that there are all kinds of people with different background stories who interpret Bible verses regarding homosexuality differently. 

I would like to come from a humble place in discussing this. It is a sensitive subject. And I love and respect people on both sides of this discussion.

However, in the last year I have discovered a new reason to investigate this subject from a more intimate point-of-view. A young family member of mine has recently come out and it has given me a personal stake in the matter. In other words, it has given me a reason to question my church's interpretation of God's intent for homosexuals. It is commonly understood in my church's Baptist denomination that it is imperative to _love the sinner, not the sin_...The belief is that God never intended for same-sex marriage to occur, although the body of my church also believes God did make some people homosexually oriented from birth.

In my mind, these ideas conflict.

It seems somewhat hasty to assume all people who are homosexually oriented from birth can only have one way to remain sinless in life: that is to remain single. I hear from my fellow Christians, it is not a sin to have homosexual feelings or thoughts, but to _act_ on it is an entirely different thing...this is where it becomes sin.

I will plainly state I do not agree with this.

I will tell you why. But I will also state I am a flawed person and I come from my own set of beliefs and background and sin. I know I am a sinful person and God's word guides me. I do believe that God's word never changes...however, I believe man's _interpretation_ of God's word throughout time does change.

When looking at the trends in history, it struck me that during the Reconstruction period, many Baptists, (particularly in Southern America) would often quote the Bible to support owning and using slaves. Today, we do not do this and racism is considered sinful in the Christian community I come from.

This is a big example of the usage of Biblical support being misrepresented with a large body of Christians supporting its interpretation. Many of us would like to think if we lived in a different period in history, we would have seen with our moral compass today what was misdirected then...I have to wager against this. I think groupthink* in any context plays a huge role in our discernment towards what we hear, agree with, acknowledge, or interpret. 

It's also important to note that while racism and homosexuality are not the same thing, both African Americans and homosexuals (or anyone belonging to LGBTQ) often feel trapped or enslaved. LGBTQ often do not feel as if there is room for them in the church because they are not given the choice for sinless same-sex love in the eyes of many believers. This means they often do not feel as if they can have a relationship with God when choosing to be themselves. 

Coming from my experience with love, I find this deeply discouraging and sad. I got married at 21-years-old and this is a _huge privilege_ because I felt encouraged, uplifted, and loved by everyone on both sides of our families. Trying to imagine myself in the shoes of a homosexual person...to receive backlash or disapproval from family members who raised me and watched me grow in love would be heartbreaking and in my eyes deeply misdirected. 

\*Groupthink: Groupthink is a psychological phenomenon that occurs within a group of people in which the desire for harmony or conformity in the group results in an irrational or dysfunctional decision-making outcome. - Wikipedia psychological definition. 

One great example of groupthink occurs in this video:

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEhSk71gUCQ>

The lady in this video walks into the social experiment expecting to get her teeth cleaned...

There is a room full of people who stand when they hear a beep every few seconds. None of them say anything about this action and remain neutral as if it is second-nature to them. The woman notices this peculiar action but does not question it either. After only a few beeps, the woman conforms to the action without question. 

The video later shows new strangers being tested in the same experiment while the first woman proceeds to stand with every beep without question until she is now the "sheep-herder" for the newcomers.

I have to wonder how much of our actions, beliefs, values, interpretations, and assumptions are in regard to those around us...especially within a church body that is large enough to fill 2,000 people. 

Back to the original article I mentioned at the top of this blog, I will go over some of my initial thoughts regarding both sides.

<https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/06/05/us/samesex-scriptures.html>

Caleb Kaltenbach, author of _Messy Grace_ believes LGBTQ should not be condemned for who they are but he is not in support of same-sex marriage. His background story is fascinating to me because both his parents came out of the closet at a young age. Here is a short video of him addressing his background and beliefs:

I like the way he approaches his story. I think he has a great heart and nothing he says offends me. However, I am left with questions. It makes me very curious after reading some of his responses to the Bible verses presented in the NYT article how his childhood affected him growing up with both parents completely switching their sexual orientation...presumably because they were in secret about it for so long. I would imagine that would be quite confusing for a young child who sees their other friends with both parents, a mom and a dad...and now for this young boy all of that changed quite dramatically. Being a loving and supportive child, it makes sense that he sought to disprove the Bible as he was growing up and began searching for more answers. I also feel it makes perfect sense that he initially wanted to disprove and ended up having a relationship with Christ. This story is commonly told for anyone who is passionate enough to do the research finds a new love and appreciation for it as well as for the people.

The opposing viewpoint comes from Matthew Vines, author of _God and the Gay Christian: The Biblical Case in Support of Same-Sex Relationships_ and is in full support of same-sex marriage. He calls other Christians to reevaluate their beliefs on this subject.

For this project in my psychology class I am called to write a summary on this NYT article I have found regarding these two men with their opposing stances on the Biblical verses quoted. One of the things I am called to look for are biases. 

Here is a link for finding bias that my teacher has provided us:
