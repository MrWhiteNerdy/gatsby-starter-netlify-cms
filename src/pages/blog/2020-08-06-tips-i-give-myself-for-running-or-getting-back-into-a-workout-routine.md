title: Getting Back into a Workout Routine After a Slump

  Did you experience a slum in your workout routine like I did when COVID orders
  kept us inside? I think I stopped running for a solid 2, maybe 2.5 months.
  Before we were kept inside I would consistently jog every single day, some
  days for as long as 1 hour. Let's just say my body did not appreciate the
  neglect! Here are some things I've taught myself to slowly change my mindset
  about moving and getting back into a workout that feels rewarding. *Everything
  in this post is 100% my opinion. I've taken a nutrition class in college that
  helped me learn some of this but I'm also really into learning about healthy
  food and lifestyle. Hopefully, this is encouraging to someone.* :)

1. Take a walk. Simple, right? Sometimes getting ourselves to just simply get out of the home can feel like the biggest struggle. Maybe we are comfortable inside doing our new routines whatever those may be. Personally, I have been keeping myself entertained by making lots of clay projects, playing Mario Kart with my husband, and eating a lot. That last one is definitely out of boredom. And it caught up with me in time. I gained weight which wasn't super noticeable but I also just felt unhappy. I felt lethargic, moody, uncomfortable in my own body, etc. Working out gives endorphins. They help us feel leaner, stronger, more capable, and less prone to feeling those moody blues. After a good workout (paired with the right foods in the right portions! + Sleep + Water!) I feel like I can take on the world.

I feel that I should emphasize I've only just begun working out consistently 2 days ago. I do at least 20 minutes of yoga from my favorite free online instructor on YouTube and an hour after lunch I jog for 20 minutes (hoping to raise that to 25 by Friday). So in a matter of just 2 days of doing this paired with good food and water I have done a complete 180. Last night around 9 pm I had a lot of energy left (funny how you need to exercise and *exert* energy to *gain* energy). I had so much energy in the evening that I decided to clean our entire kitchen and do the things I've been putting off foreverrr like recycling old empty bottles in our spice cabinet. I organized our shelves so that things would be more visible to us as we're cooking dinner together. I cleaned everything! I did all of this while my husband played Call of Duty with his buddies and I couldn't have been happier. Normally, I'm watching a show waiting for him to be done and then slumping into bed. But this time I had energy to spare! And it felt amazing. I felt like I had been given a new body. One that didn't have pain in my gut or feel uncomfortable for moving or bending.

2. On this note, I truly believe gut health is key (at least I've felt it is very true in myself) to overall health. When I binge eat or eat out of boredom I don't realize that is what I'm doing until later in the evening I tally up every single "snack" or meal I've made myself...and then I slap my hand to my forehead and think, 'no wonder my stomach hurts'. It sucks to realize you're doing yourself more damage when all you want is some comfort or escape or some kind of boredom-kicker. Been there. And really, *still there*. 

I think I may make a separate post about evening binge/boredom eating to track my personal progress with this. A lot of people like to post, "What I Eat in a Day" and those are fun too and I might even make one, myself. But I think sharing a personal binge eating journal would be even more honest and really help me be more accountable to myself and my own health. I hope seeing my journey is in any way encouraging or helpful to anyone in a similar spot! Not because I have it together, but because I know I don't mind sharing/being open about my struggles.

I don't believe life is about getting things perfect. But I do believe in progress. And that is what helps move me forward. There may be things I'll always be like, "um, yeah, I didn't *have* to eat that..." but what is the fun in not enjoying your food every once in a while? My husband cracks me up. Sometimes he refuses dessert because he says he's not hungry...and every time I ask myself, 'who eats ice cream because they're hungry??' Maybe a more accurate response would be, "I'm full." Then, I would completely understand not wanting dessert. But there's a difference. I think we all like to enjoy our treats. But let us not become blind to when our bodies are telling us they've had enough. Sometimes those hormones that tell us, "I'm full! Stop eating!" are muted or damaged. That's when we have to make a conscious effort to see what changes need to happen for us to feel good. That is what I'm judging. Not the look in the mirror, not the number on the scale, but how do I *Really feel* internally? Do I have energy to do everything I need to do? How am I feeling emotionally? Am I feeling capable to take on challenge today? Do I feel more or less social after I workout? What did I eat today? How much did I eat today? These are the questions I check in with myself.

3. These next tips are more specific for runners or joggers...or for people like me who are really trying to get back into their running/jogging routine! 

* First, I made a chart to track what I do each day. I prefer to see these things in physical form as opposed to tracking it on a phone where I'm less likely to see it when I walk through my home and think about my day. I write down what I did each day, how long, what I learned, and a goal for the future. The following things are some tips I've given myself or some things I've learned:

  \- Wait at least 1 hour after eating to go jogging

  \- Drink plenty of water throughout the morning and before your jog

  \- I love using my wireless headphones connected to a playlist on YouTube and a baseball cap (to keep my hair pinned down)

  \- This one sorta ties in with the last point - MUSIC is huge. I switch back and forth between believing it is better to stick with the song you're on even if you're not totally feeling it at first to believing it's more helpful to search for any specific song you know you're in the mood for. Whichever suits you more. Or maybe the sound of your own breathing and the lovely chirping of birds is all you need!

  \- Even if you think you're just going on a walk (talking to myself), be prepared to jog with the right clothes. For me, that means a supportive sports bra, tennis shoes, leggings, and a comfortable t-shirt. I say this because some days I feel so lethargic and not in the mood when I'm inside. Jogging sounds like running before learning to walk. So once I warm up a bit with an easy walk and get out into the fresh air with some nice sun I realize I'm actually more ready to jog than I realized. There's nothing worse than wearing sandals but feeling in the mood to jog. You have to go back home, change, go back outside, potentially warm up again, etc. It just wastes time. 

  \- Wear the same workout clothes or have two workout outfits that you wear interchangeably. This just makes the step of deciding what to wear that much easier and less of a hassle when you get that motivation to get moving. You can also toss your clothes in the washer as soon as you get home after stretching a bit and getting into the shower. So, in other words, clean your clothes while you're cleaning your body! Just to make it one quick step. That way they're ready for you again the next day!

  Side note...try not to machine dry your spandex. Air-dry if you can! Machine-drying will shorten the life of your stretchy pants (said in Nacho Libre accent lol) and make them scratchy and less fun to wear!

  \- Controlled deep breathing. When our bodies exert of lot of energy, our breathing becomes compromised. I've noticed when I purposefully challenge myself to have deep long inhale and exhales as I'm jogging and becoming more tired, I tend to hold out longer. Remember, you are in control of your body. 

  \- Daydream as you run. Think of things you wouldn't normally venture to in your daily routine. Let your mind explore things that make you happy, excited, or spontaneous. For instance, I love to daydream that I'm dancing on a stage while I'm jogging or singing in a rock band. This has a lot to do with my music choices. But you get the idea. Make yourself feel like a star when you're moving your body because you are doing this for you and it should make you feel wonderful to move and be free!

  \- TRUST it will get easier. The first day of working out feels painful not only because your body is not used to the movements but also because you may have forgotten what specific movements or workouts you actually enjoy. There will be trial and error in the process of finding your go-to things that give you joy. Don't give up on everything just because it's too hard. But be easy on yourself if you learn running is your least favorite thing in the world. There are a million different ways to exercise. Maybe your exercise is with a friend doing a competitive sport or an individual sport like dancing.

  \- When you run, imagine your body like a rubber band. I like to move my hips in motion with my steps and imagine my legs and hips getting leaner and more flexible with each movement. However, unlike a rubber band, the more stretch and pressure, the STRONGER you get! Aren't our bodies amazing? They want to move and breathe and feel energetic. Just as life, they adjust to the strain in time.

This is all I have for now. Thank you so much for reading. I send you love and happiness and I wish you the best in your exercise/workout goals. We deserve so much energy and happiness and ease in our bodies.

\- much love,
