First off, I want to say how much I value my therapist. She has been with us during some difficult transition periods for my husband and I. Most people who know us would not initially expect that we see a therapist. However, being as young as we both are we initially felt it was the right choice for the longevity and health of our marriage. Eventually we began visiting her individually as well. I think everyone who has the means to seek outside advice should do it. It is a wonderful way to not only get some tangible help for everyday problems but keep mental health a priority which all too often gets left for last. I also feel it is extremely important to find someone you feel respected by and hopefully feel a connection with. I often think of my therapist as my trusted friend. We actually laugh a lot while in session with her as well as dig into some difficult topics. Do I still get nervous before my sessions? - Absolutely. But I still know that she has things to offer both of us that will help. 

When she introduced EMDR to us, I was intrigued. Essentially she described the process as holding two little hand-held devices in each palm which will buzz and vibrate simultaneously stimulating opposite sides of the brain so they begin communicating with each other. The pathways in the brain as you are guided through this process with the help of trained professional is suppose to help you unlearn something. A great example is body image or feelings of inadequacy. 

I tried EMDR for my nasty habit of skin picking. I have a compulsive psychological desire to pick at my skin...and sometimes it lasts for as long as half an hour or more. It got to be out of control. That is when I decided to give this form of therapy a go.

During the session, I held the controls in each hand and just as described they would vibrate. Later, she told me that I could try this same method at home by tapping each foot simultaneously and breathing deeply as we practiced. This part goes by many names...meditation, deep breathing, mindfulness, etc. What is important is to calm the mind and focus on the inhale and exhale. As we continued this, I closed my eyes to concentrate. It was a bit challenging to empty my mind while coordinating my breath and trying to relax my shoulders all at once. However, once I was able to get there my therapist would ask me what I noticed.

This was a completely open-ended question. It could be something small like a tingling sensation in the arms/hands or maybe something in your thoughts that struck you.

Eventually with enough concentration and relaxation, as you continue your therapist may focus on what you are hoping to unlearn. In my specific scenario, I wanted to stop compulsively picking at my skin so she asked me some of my earliest memories of feeling inadequate because she believed this compulsive body image behavior stemmed from this belief. I am always reluctant to admit I struggle with body image. I feel that most people do struggle to some degree. But over time I've learned to become more confident and relaxed. However, it does not mean I still have a lot of insecurities intertwined inside that stem deep down from core memories. 

We began looking at a few of my core memories and how those memories began the building blocks for things I still relate to today. Memory is not an exact copy of the past...it is repeatedly changed and manipulated by multiple influences. There are many instances when humans are actually capable of "remembering" entire events that never actually occurred...and this happens for everyone, even those who feel their mental health is completely fine. 

So as I was describing to my therapist some memories I could recall of my childhood self, it dawned on me that these memories might be almost if not entirely made up! How else can one explain vividly remembering a brief interaction between a parent and a child at the age of 8 or younger? One reason may be that this interaction stimulated such strong synapses that it stayed in the memory and forever since that memory there has been a chain or link of continual experiences of everyday life associated to that specific memory.

Wild, right??

I only went through one session so there is much work to be done still. However, I can tell you I have picked at my skin far less than before. I don't believe I am "cured" of my compulsive behavior but I also feel with more sessions there may be more progress.

It is a challenge to dig deep into those ugly feelings - the statements that we resist to tell even ourselves such as "I feel lonely" or "I feel inadequate" but once you are able to fully open up and be honest about the ugly, there is a lot of good that can be achieved. "Rewiring" the brain is no simple task...it takes a lot of difficult work. Be proud of yourself if this is you. I'm proud of you! And I hope whatever method of mindfulness or mental wellbeing you choose that you find yourself feeling refreshed on the other side.



Love, Rachel.
