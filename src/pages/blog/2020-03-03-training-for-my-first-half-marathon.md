title: Training for My First 10K

description: >-
  I decided a great way to keep myself motivated throughout my training is to
  document my workouts. Each day I'll try to type out a quick summary of what I
  accomplished or something specific I want to work on. Realistically, I likely
  will not work out every single day or I may not be able to describe each day
  but that's okay. Mostly I want to be overall more consistent with my training
  and to avoid feeling discouraged, lethargic, or bored with the things I'm
  doing.

My nutrition teacher told us once that the best way to figure out what we might be lacking in our diets is simply to write down what we eat and see if there are any missing components or repetitious patterns. I believe the same could be said for a workout routine. If you are anything like me it's important to keep workouts interesting and fun. I used to hate the idea of getting on a treadmill 3(+) times a week to get in my daily dose of 30(+) minutes a day...

However, very recently things have been changing. I have found some successful tips that seem to combat those things that might cause me to skip a workout (such as boredom, feeling lethargic/sometimes even slightly depressed). I will say that these tips are not "fool-proof" and they may not work for everyone. But if you read these tips you might get some good ideas for yourself what could work for you. I don't see these things being talked about very often and I think they're somewhat unique or creative (which suits me completely). If you are a creative or artistic person, these ideas might be your _bread and butter_!

TIPS FOR CONSISTENT RESULTS:

1. The importance of daydreams
2. The importance of music
3. Finding your why
4. Processing your day in detail - specifically things that frustrate/anger/challenge you 
5. Movement (not as simple as it may sound)
6. Blocking out your self-consciousness or inner criticism 
7. Freedom to be loose, spontaneous, wild, or even child-like
8. Asking yourself what sort of practice you are needing for each specific day - checking in with yourself on how much energy you can spend or which specific body part you might want to focus on
9. Exhale and go deeper
10. The power of breath-control
11. Walk and talk
12. Sunshine, nature, and singing birds are gifts
13. Find a quiet place to pause and reflect before, during, after a workout
14. Choosing comfort, support, and style for workout gear
15. Keep in interesting with new goals and new apps
16. Find a workout buddy that will hold you responsible and make it more fun
17. Try something new - surprise yourself - sign up for ballet, spin, yoga, horseback riding, ultimate frisbee, beach volley ball, dancing, skiing, hiking, etc! The possibilities are endless. Ask yourself what you have always wanted to try even if it is much simpler than one of these. 
18. Consider getting a furry friend to motivate you off that couch for necessary potty trips. When looking for a puppy workout buddy, think of your long term goals. Do you want to eventually run a marathon? That poodle might be enough to get you off the couch but will it keep your stride when you really begin to train? But what the heck, buy the poodle.
19. (Do this one with caution - could get yourself into trouble if this is the only tip you use) Take pictures of yourself after each workout or to watch yourself change. I say that this one should be implemented with caution because I used to do this regularly and I still have most of the pictures. But it became an obsession to always improve my appearance over how I was feeling internally...so much that it spurred on an eating disorder and constant working out...I do not recommend taking pictures habitually especially if you see yourself following any of these traits. However, it might be a cool idea to share your pic with a workout buddy or a specialist/trainer to help keep you responsible. That post-workout glow is hard to fake (especially if you're anything like me and you have blotchy red spots all over the face).
20. Keep a water-bottle with you everywhere you go. (Did she say everywhere? YES, EVERYWHERE.)
21. Check your socks. (This one is especially important for runners or dancers). Different socks hold different purpose, that goes without saying. But if you feel blisters constantly or feet feel hot/heavy/uncomfortable it could be as simple as finding some quality workout socks specifically geared for the types of activity you're trying to do. There are also special stores that have you test out a pair shoes on a treadmill to get an accurate fitting and best feeling shoe for your runs!

PERSONAL DAILY WORKOUT JOURNAL:

(days I do not list are most likely very light activity)

Tuesday, March 3, 2020: 3 miles on the treadmill at 5.5 mph without stopping.

Wednesday, March 4, 2020: 3 miles on treadmill at speeds ranging between 3.5-6.5. I pushed myself harder to go faster today which would explain why I had to take a break to walk a bit in between. Still, I am proud of myself for finishing all 3 miles. Today I thought about the importance of finding something to set my sights on or feel empowered by (and this is at times a bit of a struggle especially if you feel you are lacking in purpose or find yourself stuck in a rut that no longer "does the trick") Tomorrow I might try training outside to mix it up and keep my surroundings interesting.

Thursday, March 5, 2020: Mostly a break day - just some yoga.

Friday, March 6, 2020: I pushed myself a bit faster today at shorter bursts of energy ranging between 7.5-3.5 for about 1.5 miles.

Monday, March 9, 2020: ran for 4 miles (first mile was at 6.5, and the last 3 were at 5.5)

Wednesday, March 11, 2020: jogged for about 30 minutes in the sunshine :)

Friday, March 13, 2020: jogged for a full hour

Saturday, March 14, 2020: jogged for a full hour

Sunday, March 15, 2020: break day

Monday, March 16, 2020: jogged for an hour

Tuesday, March 17, 2020: jogged for an hour

Wednesday, March 18, 2020: jogged for only 20 minutes (I need to be more mindful of my period and how it influences my running - I had to stop because I was so sore from the past few days and I had pretty bad cramps)

Thursday, March 19, 2020: break day

Friday, March 20, 2020: indoor cardio workout and yoga

Wednesday, March 25, 2020: went to park with husband and played frisbee for about 25 minutes

Thursday, March 26, 2020: jogged for about 10 minutes and walked for about an hour (while talking on the phone with my sister <3) and played more frisbee with the husband
