  These are my favorite tools when making my polymer clay charms. I'll break it
  down by each one and give some of my favorite necessities vs. ones you can
  easily substitute with household items.

Here are some cake charms I made using a roller, a small round cookie cutter, plastic wrap, an x-acto knife, a needle tool, liquid clay (TLS), and some eye pins! Last but not least, I strategically placed UV resin to only the "fruit" sections to give it a shinny appearance.

Before cutting the pieces I also froze the cake to help it maintain its shape.

Here is another example I've created using my fingers (you might be surprised how often your own finger tips feel like the best tools!), liquid clay, chalk pastel powders, a fan brush, a baby toothbrush for texture, and eye pins! Once again, I added UV resin to only the areas I felt needed to be shinny (in this case, the melted butter.)



Now that you've seen a couple of my charms I'll dive into the details of the tools I love to use and highly recommend.

I realize this looks like a lot. To someone new to polymer clay I would recommend only paying attention to these handful of tools listed in the picture: 

1. needle tool (or toothpick)

2. clay roller (or a cup or smooth rounded pencil/other utensil)

3. Premo translucent (yes, I would put this at the top of my necessities list and I'll explain further down)

4. x-acto knife. 

The reason I would suggest Premo translucent clay in my necessities list (even for beginners) is because translucent clay (of any brand) will help give your clay a more satisfying appearance. Of course, this is personal preference. I really enjoy the effect it gives (both in creating a more realistic appearance and in helping to create muted or pastel shades) and it helps make colors last a lot longer!

I suggest Premo because it pairs nicely with Fimo soft (which is my favorite). Fimo soft gets a bad rep for being really difficult to condition which is totally true. 

However, firm clay serves a purpose. There is a reason professional polymer clay is seemingly impossible to condition (which simply means make malleable or workable/soft in your hands). 

I really love having Fimo soft which is still a bit harder to condition especially when paired with Premo translucent because it gives me the range of softness I need in order to work on small intricate details without losing the texture or surface that I work so hard to achieve. When I want something to be both highly translucent and firm, I just stick my work in the freezer for a bit and that also helps firm up the clay!

Another couple of reasons I love Fimo is because the range of colors seem to be unmatched by any other bake-able polymer clay and this may be partly because it was the first bake-able polymer clay in 1954. <https://www.staedtler.com/dk/en/discover/what-is-fimo-actually-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-popular-colourful-modelling-clay-from/>

Back to the tools!

I'd like to say how important it is to keep your work surface clean. You don't need any fancy cleaning equipment or tools to do this. Simply using paper towels, cotton swabs/q-tips, hand-sanitizer (which helps condition your hands as well as clean your work surface), and rubbing alcohol work perfectly!

As for what to use *for your work surface -* I recommend buying a sheet of glass! Or simply take a sheet of glass out of an old picture frame you're not using anymore! If you enjoy making smaller works of art like me, a picture frame size should suit you just fine!

I also recommend trying ceramic tiles. These are wonderful for projects that are super tiny, detailed, or difficult to transfer to a baking sheet. The reason is you can safely bake the clay directly onto the tile. So it's a work surface and a baking surface in one!

However I will say it can create a shinny bottom to your clay after it's been baked. If this bothers you, opt for a regular baking sheet with parchment paper.

Here are some additional tools that I find very helpful in my work. Plastic wrap can be used to help create a smooth appearance on your clay if you don't want to directly touch it with your fingers. (This is great for creating smooth dome shapes - think cake or buttons!) Plastic wrap is also wonderful for keeping dust away on projects that you'd like to take a break from (as pictured).

I would also recommend buying or making your own drying racks if you intend on glazing or applying resin to your clay after it's been baked. This is applicable to pieces that have an eye pin or hoop to hang from a paper clip (as pictured). I found this wonderful and inexpensive tip for hanging clay charms from one of my favorite polymer clay YouTubers, Creative Rachy! :) Plus, she has an awesome name, haha ;)

Of course, eye pins of varying lengths will be helpful if you are also interested in creating charms. I would suggest buying them on the shorter side so you don't need to manually cut each piece yourself. This is just a step to save time.

And last but not least, a sketch book and a box to store your things are very helpful in your creations! Keeping your clay in a box can help prevent dust or hairs from getting into your clay. Polymer does not harden until it is in the oven, but it is still a good idea to keep it stored away in a dry, dark place.

I would also highly recommend buying a divider such as this one if you have multiple blocks of clay that you'd like to separate by color. This will ensure your colors do not mix until you want them to!

Plastic dividers are also wonderful for storing jewelry fixings and other tools you don't have a spot for.

I store my frequently used hand tools in a mason jar near my glass surface for easy access. As for the hand clay tools I do not frequently use, I keep those in a paint brush holder to keep organized.

A bulk set of plastic tubs are a great economical option for storing small bits of clay or tools as well!

With those plastic tubs I just showed in the previous picture, this is what I decided to do with them. I use them to store and organize my charms. I cut up a thin cardboard cracker box to create the organizer you see at the bottom. Later on I can post how I created that in more detail! That is a great alternative if you would like to become more organized but want to save some money and maybe possibly reduce/reuse/recycle (\*que the Jack Johnson song\*).\

The last thing I will mention is to simply enjoy the space you're in. Fill it with things on the wall that inspire you. Make sure you truly enjoy being in your crafting spot especially if you plan on being there for long periods. It will do wonders for your mindset and your attitude about working!

That's all for now. Thank you so much for reading. I hope I gave you some tips that prove to be helpful. Happy sculpting to all my polymer clay artists! I hope you have a wonderful day.

Much love, Rachel Alivia
