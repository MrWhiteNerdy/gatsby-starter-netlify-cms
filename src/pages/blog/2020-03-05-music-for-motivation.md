  These are some of my favorite songs to listen to while working out. When I use
  music to motivate me it truly becomes the best part of my day. I look forward
  to working out every day because of the power of music and daydreams. They
  help me channel the parts of myself that don't know how to feel...the parts of
  me that hide from me but my body knows what to feel. My body knows what to say
  when my mouth doesn't...the parts that feel sad or angry or shut out - music
  channels it into something good. I like to listen to the lyrics really closely
  and think of what they might be telling me at any given moment.

I'm always looking for new music so my inventory never gets dull. The moment that happens I feel it because I'm not able to reach that _beyond reality feeling_ - when the daydream feels so real I'm in an entirely different place and I feel changed like I'm an alter ego version of myself. I'm more introverted than extroverted but I admire the passion and intensity of expressing yourself and expressing anger in a meaningful way. 

In my daydreams I'm usually imagining myself doing something aggressive or strong. This is as much a soul-searching task as it is just to get a good workout. As a young woman, I ask myself all the time, how do I want to make my mark? Do I want to challenge femininity standards or break them? In my thoughts I'm usually finding a way to fulfill both in that complex standard we set for ourselves and everyone else...sometimes this alone makes me angry or feel exhausted. 

I found out that getting in my 30 minutes a day doesn't do much for me long term if all I'm doing is trying to meet a standard goal of movement with no vision. If you're an artistic person like me, you crave vision and some kind of purpose driving you in almost all things. What I'm describing goes by different names - meditate, mindfulness, waking dreams, imagination, "going to your happy place," or simply daydreams.
