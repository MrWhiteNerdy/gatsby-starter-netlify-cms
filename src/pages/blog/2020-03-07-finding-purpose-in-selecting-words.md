Have you ever heard a word and felt amused because it rang just right for the moment and emotion?

Have you ever tried meditating to a single word? 

Or have you ever tried writing poetry by changing the meaning of a word while still allowing the reader to sense the true meaning you're assigning it?

They say a picture is worth a 1,000 words. If this is true each word carries with it a vast array of implications and contextual uses that make them unique and appropriate for specific uses. However, using a word in a different context while still maintaining its fundamental definition is a great secret to having a good sense of humor. Imagine you are grocery shopping with a friend and you hear them proclaim, "What a cultured composition the clerks have arranged these mandarins in!" You would probably tilt your head and look at them with a bewildered smile or ignore it completely because what do you say to such a bizarre sentence? However, if he were using those words in the context of an art museum, you would most likely look at him in awe for his intelligence and poise. Being in a grocery store, the words look sarcastic and silly - although, they technically by definition could very well match the scenario. 

Words are fun this way. They can be thoughtfully interchanged for different uses to catch the audience or readers by surprise. They can be used to impress, compel, suggest, or express confidence.

Lately, I've been using my Grammarly tone indicator for most of my email interactions and even after proofreading some of my papers for school. I find it fascinating how quickly your tone expression can be detected by a standard already built into our every day communication - it is necessary in many cases to choose the standard for communication when you are less familiar with the person and want to be perceived in a specific way. Confidence can come off as dictatorial or arrogant. Easy-going can be confused with aloof, indecisive, or standoffish. And with each of these words there are a million more to branch off of with different connotations and feelings attached to each one. 

A great exercise for a Graphic Designer or artist who is branding themselves is to sit down with a list of ideas and words they want to associate their brand with. This is probably a good idea to get some opinions of all kinds of people who you know to figure out if the name of your brand and its slogan or even the logo match with your intentions. Make sure when you ask your friends/family/associates for their opinions to be open-minded _both when asking the question and when gathering information from their opinions_ and be prepared for a change-up. It is easy to imagine our brand/logo/design to portray a specific meaning to us with our individual makeup/background/ideals but to the majority of the people we are selling to it portrays an entirely different meaning.

Be as neutral as possible when asking for opinions on design such as, "What do you think?" or "What does it immediately make you feel?"

These open-ended questions allows for space for that person to not only be honest but avoid leading them to answer a specific answer that may not match how they actually feel. Ex: "Do you think the design is feminine?" might give them the impression you want it to look feminine or masculine depending on your tone when they would have answered something completely different to a more neutral question by answering something such as, "I think it has too much blue." This answer is usually more helpful in the end. Although, you may disagree if you gather up enough opinions and it seems to be a consistent theme that people feel there is too much blue...it maybe time to change the color scheme. 

The way you ask a question (in tone, inflection, body language, _and_ word choice) has a LOT to do with the way a person answers you no matter what the intent of the question is.

This is just one example of how powerful word choices; how they can influence the direction of design and life all around us.
