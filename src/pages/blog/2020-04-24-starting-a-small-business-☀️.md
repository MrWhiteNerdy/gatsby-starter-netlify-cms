  Hello! I am pleased to announce I will soon be starting a small business in
  making adorable kawaii polymer clay charms. I will soon have my shop live on
  storenvy.com. I cannot wait to share all of my tiny, adorable creations with
  you all! :)

Here I will go through some of my plans with starting this small business as well as a couple sneak peaks of my work! :)

1. Create. Create. Create! In order to have a shop I first need to have plenty of product! This is also a good test to know the longevity of my shop. My interests can quickly fizzle. Watching my interest in this hobby grow as time passes will naturally tell me if this is something I will invest my time in for as long as it takes to grow into a lucrative business. No harm, no foul if not :)

2. Use free service to set up an online shop with Storenvy.

3. Start a YouTube channel. This one will take quite a bit of practice and patience. I am completely new to the field of video making and editing. The amount of knowledge to learn is quite daunting. But I'm sure with a good attitude and again, tons of patience it can be done!

4. Find a way to link social media accounts to each other so I don't need to post to every single one each time I upload content.

5. Keep track of expenses and timing in my creations to come up with a reasonable price.

6. Focus on the product! Once again, I'm going to take it back home to the reason I started this in the first place. The first mission is to make something I enjoy, not to gain followers and money (although, those would be nice too!) But in order for me to truly enjoy this mission I need to keep this primary goal as my top priority. If I don't enjoy creating charms in a couple years from now, there is absolutely no obligation for me to continue. However, if it does grow into something I enjoy full-time, I will be so happy that I took this leap to try! :) 

I hope this blog inspires you if you are like me and wondering if it's time for you to create a small business of your own whatever the product may be.

I say go for it! And let me know if this encouraged you! I would love to hear my words make a difference for those who stumble upon them.



All my love, Rachel Alivia

P.S.

As promised, here are some sneak peaks to my polymer clay charm creations! I hope you enjoy looking at them as much as I do! (And I enjoy holding them even more!)
