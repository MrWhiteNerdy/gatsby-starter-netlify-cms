  In this post, I'll share some personal advice that I tell myself in order to
  keep or gain confidence. Running a small business can feel daunting and
  exhausting but there is courage and strength in enduring the difficult, slow
  beginnings.

A lot of artists have what's called "the imposter syndrome." And it's not just artists. It can happen in any profession. It can feel like a huge setback when your own confidence is fighting against you making you feel as if it's pointless to even try. I think this is a big reason a lot of people do not want to pursue their true desires whether this is running their own business or leaving their current position to find a new one. Whatever the reason, it does take a lot of courage to get started. I want to share some of my thoughts that I think are important now that I'm currently going through this, myself.

1. Does this desire to start something new give you new fulfillment, joy, hope, purpose? If it is an idea for a small business, will the passion for creating or selling be enough to make you feel fulfilled? Is your passion long-lasting? Sometimes this doesn't come to us right away. Maybe you're like me and you'd rather test the waters to find out than puzzle it in your mind for months before starting. (Both methods are perfectly fine - they're just different methods.) 

2. Can you structure your life to fit in time for both this new passion and to take care of yourself and other responsibilities? This should be a yes. Don't let your new passion/small business override everything. 

3. Try not to be impatient with yourself or your growth. You may be really aware of your skills or abilities, for good or for bad. You might be feeling a bit inadaquate when you compare yourself to others. This is a sure way to loose sight of what's important. Use comparision to fuel you to find a competitive edge if possible. Let this competitiveness be good-natured and curious, rather than revengeful or spiteful. And try not to let comparison become the reason. Or else your drive will probably fizzle.

I have a difficult time with the word talent, especially when referring to artists. I am an artist and every once in a while someone gives me this compliment. It's a nice thing to hear and be reminded that people like to see my art. But what strikes me is that I don't fully believe it is something that only specific people possess. I think a lot of artists develop their skill by lifelong practice. Or they develop their own cohesive style and taste after testing different things and experimenting. My point is don't let the word *talent* throw you off. People can change and mold into anything they want to be with the drive and stamnia. Which leads me to my final point.

4. Focus on your drive. This is something that keeps you going even on days when it feels challenging. Maybe it can be an escape, a release, a secret pleasure that only you know how to take enjoyment from...or it can bring joy to others and in turn gives you deeper purpose and meaning. It can feel really satisfying to bring others joy. Whatever it is, it makes you feel fulfilled enough to do it day after day after day and not get sick of it. Sure, at times we all need some inspiration. This is normal. Realistically try to picture yourself years down the road with this goal you have for starting a new business. Can you picture it? Is it something you would enjoy doing long term? And give yourself grace if you have a difficult time imagining it. Start with baby steps. You have good goals/dreams if they scare you a little. This probably means they're full of character-developing qualities that would push your current self to become who you're meant to be. Embrace it! :)

5. This last one I haven't fully decided on. Social media is pretty necessary in promoting most small businesses. I have not fully decided how often I want to devote my time on social media. I believe it is important to mingle with other like-minded people and exchange ideas, kind words, or inspiration. However, it can become draining and obsessive if not kept in check. If the time you give to social media begins to feel like a chore, you're on it for too long. This is my humble opinion. However, I do believe every day is a little different and it's never a bad idea to listen to how you are feeling in any given day/moment.
