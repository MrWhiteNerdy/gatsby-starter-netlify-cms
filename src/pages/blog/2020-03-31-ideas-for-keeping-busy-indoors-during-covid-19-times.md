* Consider adopting a pet if you have the means to do so (here in my arms I am holding our new kitten, Peach! She has been a wonderful distraction these past couple of weeks...something to care for, love, play with, laugh with, and a wonderful way to keep my husband and I from getting too irritated with each other from all the time spent in a small space alone! Lol. Later, I'll post a blog about all my purchases for Peach that I highly recommend! â™¡)
* Indulge in a decadent meal - if made for two, try having a romantic date at home including all the works such as candle light and wine in your finest glasses and even dressing up for each other :) 
* Or enjoy a night all to yourself! - make a list of all your favorites like a favorite movie/TV show, food, clothing, slippers, etc. Whatever that looks like gather up all the things you need to host a special evening for yourself and have some quality me-time! Personally, I would start with making a bubble bath, do my toenails and then cozy up with Peach and a good show or movie\* and some snacks! Then I might make something crafty using clay or paint. Currently I love watching tutorials by Creative Rachy on youtube - I adore her style. \*I'll also make a post a list of some of my favorite movies/shows right now
* Spend an hour or so talking on the phone with a loved one! That saying that tells you to keep people close that feel like sunshine....this is everything. Keep those people in your life that make you feel inspired, happy, warm, enlightened, or motivated! Be honest with how much communication you like/need to have in order to stay mentally stimulated and well whether that's a little or a lot. Everyone is different in their needs! :)
* If you are a student like I am and you're dreading doing everything online, try setting a schedule for yourself that you can realistically stick to. Each day you can modify it a bit to make it more manageable for your needs. Set timers. Notice the changes you implement that help make you feel more productive, even if that means waking up 30 minutes earlier and going to bed earlier.
* Aim to do one thing that you are not looking forward to (such as complete a task for work or school) and complete one thing you DO look forward to...all in balance!
* Play video games! (we recently bought a switch and it is loads of fun!)



That's all for now! I hope you all are staying well during these hard times!

Love, Rachel.
