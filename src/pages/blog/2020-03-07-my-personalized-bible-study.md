  My greatest advice: Start where you are.

  Every plant has a dormant season and every plant has special requirements.
  Here's an opportunity to find your requirements using God's word to shine and
  grow. 

  John 15.

I own the CSB (Christian Standard Bible) study Bible through Holman Bibles Publishers. I enjoy having a study Bible for the extra sources and articles provided. It makes the experience feel like an in-depth research that I can appreciate. 

However, all the information out there and in the Bible can feel overwhelming. I have had a goal to finish reading the Bible from cover-to-cover for years now and something always stops me from completing it.

I want to renew that goal but make it a more practical promise for my life. Instead of 1 year, I'll aim for 3 years. Since I have jumped around from book-to-book, I'll make it a goal to highlight and annotate all parts of the Bible by the end of the 3 years in 2023 (for my sake in knowing which sections I have covered.) The Bible is wonderful because every time I read it even if it is a familiar passage, it has new meaning.

I hope to renew my purpose each and every time I read.

Here are some great tips I read from the study Bible I own:

1. Read the Bible prayerfully
2. Read expectantly and joyfully
3. Meditate on what you are reading
4. Read for transformation
5. Read with perseverance
6. Be realistic about the goals you set, and have a good plan
7. Set aside a consistent time and place to read and study the Bible
8. Read with a few good tools at hand
9. Read with a pen in hand
10. Read in light of the immediate context
11. Do your Bible reading and study as part of a community
12. Read in light of the overarching story of the Bible

I found this to be an excellent simplistic approach.

A couple of these numbered points I'd like to address within myself are 6, 9, and possibly 11. I'd love to find a couple of people to read the Bible with consistently but there are some requirements that would need to be put in place first.

It is quite an intimate activity. Reading the Bible with anyone requires a firm purpose/goal and trust. I would love to do with with a close family member or a friend that I can develop a bond with. I also feel face-to-face or over the phone interactions might be best in analyzing a passage for its fullness and beautiful complexity or simplicity. 

I'm not great with keeping schedules. What motivates me to do anything is usually centered on curiosity, creativity, inspiration, and feeling safe or connected.

If I can continue to read the Bible with this energy in place, I'm in good hands.

Some realistic goals I'd like to begin focusing on as far as finding an enjoyable space to rely on include:

* Pens in hand
* Good mindset - Do I feel good about what I am doing? Do I feel stressed or anxious? What do I want to change and why? 
* Quiet space
* Not in a rush
* Phone with Bible app in hand to quickly find and highlight notes or do additional research 
* Perhaps a cup of warm coffee or tea
* Sunny window or outside in warm weather 
* Close eyes and bow head to meditate on specific verses/passages that help you feel the Spirit
* Blend yoga movements with Bible study
* Try listening to classical music as you read
* Study small bits at a time that feel transformative to you
* Smile before you begin reading
* Share your happiness, reflectiveness, or questions with people you trust and will receive you well
* Write in journal your thoughts with an open-ended mind - don't criticize your own writing - write as if you are speaking directly to God or yourself
* Have a stone or small toy to hold in hand instead of picking at skin when stressed or nervous
* Walk away for some time if feeling overwhelmed with the objective of coming back at a better time
* Aim to read about 1-2 books each month and renew goals as often as needed :)
