Shampoo:

\*Baking soda (1 tbs or more per bottle)

\*Water

Conditioner:

\*Apple cider vinegar (1 tbs or more per bottle)

\*Water

It is that simple! These are amazing and completely customizable. I have been using this on my hair for about 2 weeks now. I wash my hair a lot less now that I'm exercising less and I also find that my natural oils don't truly need to be washed as frequently. There is a transition period where your scalp may feel a bit gunky or clogged. Do not fret, this will pass! Once it does, you will save your hair/body tons of unnecessary chemicals, sulfates, fragrances and money! These ingredients last a very long time and are extremely affordable.

You can put them in spray bottles and give your hair a touch up whenever it is feeling a bit oily or frizzy. Apple cider vinegar is wonderful especially for thicker coarser hair because it conditions. I love using it because it is one of the only natural ingredients that is an all in one for my needs, including my home!

I recently got a kitty and her dandruff was bothering me quite a bit. I keep a spray bottle of apple cider vinegar and water by me whenever I'm feeling a bit itchy and spray it directly on my face or wherever I'm feeling it the worst and it does an amazing job! It is a natural cleaner. You can spray it on your pillows for a better night's rest. Or try spraying it on a washcloth to clean your pets! It does not harm them whatsoever.

As I mentioned, these ingredients are 100% customizable. You can add your choice of essential oil (be careful if you are using this for pets - use in very small increments or do your research to make sure you pet is not allergic or bothered by the essential oil).

You can also put a bit of Dr. Bronner's liquid castile soap into the shampoo mixture if you miss that fizzing action on your scalp. Dr. Bronner's soap is a wonderful natural alternative to shampoos as well, combined with the water and baking soda and you have a winning solution! 

No need to spend a fortune on shampoos and conditioners advertised as 100% all natural or that help grow your hair. These are just wonderful for the home and the body and the pets AND the laundry!! I honestly can't think of anything that does a better job of cleaning everything while still being completely affordable.

I should also mention that if you are hesitant about using apple cider vinegar on your hair because of the smell, diluting it will help. It also helps by using some essential oil. My favorites are peppermint and lavender. You should also know that once the hair is completely dry, you no longer smell the vinegar and others around you are not likely to detect it either.

I often ask my husband if I smell like vinegar and he shrugs and says, "it just smells like you're wearing hair product." If that doesn't convince you, try it before you knock it...and over time the people around you may adjust to it as well ;)
