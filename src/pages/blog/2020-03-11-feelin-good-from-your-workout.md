title: 'Feelin'' Good from Exercise & Physical Activity '

  Exercise: 30 mins a day or 150 minutes per week is the recommended amount for
  adults. Exercise is different from physical activity. Physical activity is the
  daily movement we use in completing simple tasks such as going grocery
  shopping, reaching for a box from the cupboard, fixing dinner, folding
  laundry, walking across a parking lot, etc. If a person does a lot of physical
  activity each day, their daily required exercise may be minimized. However, it
  is a good rule of thumb to aim for both every day.

Each day comes with new challenges, new thoughts, new expectations and limitations. Be kind on yourself when you are not able to follow-through with your own goals or expectations...be kind enough to not expect perfection. Be _so_ _kind_ to yourself that you allow yourself to fail and then _get back up_. That last part is crucial. Do not stay down.

I tell myself these things because I know that I struggle with these bad.

I don't like to fail by my own standards. And I am hard on myself. In the same measure, there are moments or days or weeks where I'm just not feelin' it. I feel like staying in my sweats, eating way too much food, and binging some mindless show, curbing all responsibilities. And then I hate myself afterwards. Usually, there's some blockage going on in my mind and spirit if I do these things. That's not to say these things can't be chosen purely for their enjoyment. That is totally possible and satisfying. 

However, this morning started off rough for me. I felt like a heavy weight and there are times when everything feels a bit pointless. Those are the moments I feel lackluster and a little sad. 

It can be a real challenge some days to choose healthy choices for mind, body, and soul. Immediately, my brain rejected the idea of working out when I was in my funk. I think this is because a sad person doesn't feel much like moving. (At least for me.) When I'm feeling sad I don't feel like doing even the basic physical activity that life demands. Grabbing that box from the pantry suddenly feels a lot harder. These moods usually do not last for long periods and I often am able to snap back. Depression, even in its mild forms is a battle. Any mental illness (which is relatively common), can make both physical activity and exercise more daunting and tasking. 

I want to share my personal experience with the wonderful change that exercise can make in my mood. As I have hinted, I have never been clinically diagnosed with depression. However, I know I have experienced it a few times in a mild form that lasted longer than a month. For this reason, I sympathize deeply with those who tackle depression or any mental illness. I am not an expert, especially sensing that my personal struggle with it has never been severe or needed medication...But I am proud to admit I visit a therapist and I use a few methods to keep myself going. I also believe all mental illnesses are likely more common than we would all like to admit. 

As I started, this morning began with a gloomy feeling for me...I felt void and without much direction. I got up, ate breakfast, took care of my appearance, went to class, I spoke to friends, I looked people in the eye, I laughed and smiled a few times, I drank water...My point is I felt there was no obvious reason for my mood. When people experience mental illness, it can come on like a cloud, mysterious as the weather changes in the Midwest. I know for me it was also a matter of ignoring some challenging questions I've been dealt with in the past couple weeks.

Thankfully, today has given some excellent sunshine. My husband encouraged me to go to the park to do some jogging. I bring three things with me now whenever I plan to jog...music, water, and whatever current mood I'm experiencing. That last one will almost every time feel better by the end of a workout because of the chemical changes that occur. Not everyday is perfect or works out as planned. Let us all try to forgive ourselves for that. And if you are new to working out or are not totally sold on the idea, that is okay. I try really hard not to fall into that mindset/belief that I don't need to workout _ever_...because that is just not true. But missing a few days here and there, that is perfectly normal.

As the motto goes, grace and truth combined.

It's always a good idea to try out different things to find what you look forward to and enjoy. Try to stick with something you have your sights set on long enough to find new secrets for enjoying a workout. For me, I would have never pictured myself jogging for 4 miles without stopping and still feeling good enough to keep going and I've only been training for about a month. But because I stuck with it and tested new ways to enjoy it such as using music and daydreams, I'm less inclined to stop. You might not like stretching or yoga the first day you try it because the movements are unfamiliar or painful...but by day 30, your body will feel more limber and comfortable and it will feel rewarding to watch yourself reach new heights. 

Whatever movement you are going through, be proud of yourself above everything. Exerting energy with everyday challenges can feel draining. I know what it feels like to carry an invisible weight and if that is you today, I feel for you and you aren't alone. I hope the rest of your day is filled with whatever it takes, small or big, to get you back to where you want to be. 

This is a reminder to myself how powerful a good workout truly is for getting back to feeling confident, happy, capable, myself, and even new parts of me that I haven't met yet.
