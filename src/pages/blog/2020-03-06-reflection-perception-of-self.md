  Some studies claim that women are often more critical of themselves or take
  more joy from their reflection than men. Could this be real? And what can we
  do with this information? Now that we're here, what do we do?

I had an interesting conversation with my sister yesterday. We were talking about mirrors. And each mirror in her house gives her a different feeling about herself due to lighting and (possibly) the environment. It is interesting how different a slightly different tone or hue of a room can dramatically change how you feel about your own reflection.

But then she said something that really struck me. 

"What's even real?"

It hit me we may never truly see ourselves the way our loved ones see us, the way our friends see us, coworkers, associates, parents, partners, etc. 

With mirrors and images - which comes closer to the real thing?

And _even with those things,_ how much can we truly rely on mirrors and images being accurate descriptions of us? When so much of our personalities are wrapped and warped into our mannerisms, style, body language, subtle movements, eye contact, etc. Is a selfie enough to capture the _TRUE_ essence of you and me?

Then you might argue, just film yourself. This might work except if you were to truly get a sense for what others saw of you, it would need to be put in place without you knowing. In other words, hidden nanny camera or something.

But maybe none of that is the point...To see ourselves clearly the way others see us or to get a foothold into someone else's perspective of us. 

Why are women notorious for looking at themselves 40 times a day in a mirror on average while a man is about half that number? 

I am not too shy to admit I take images of myself to feel good sometimes. But at a certain point, I get tired of it. I get tired of myself. And I get tired of the feeling I just wasted a load of time looking at myself...at for what? 

My husband already approves, even on the days and moments I don't. My friends and family love me no matter what so long as I put on a clean shirt and brush my teeth (basic hygiene doesn't really require mirrors).

Sometimes I catch myself staring and getting closer and closer to attempt to get those blackheads on my nose or the zit on my face and I get so fed up with my skin picking that I'll keep the bathroom light off just to discourage myself from looking in my reflection. 

But the reflections never stop. They are a constant reminder all around us: glass doors, windows, the surface of our metallic utensils or pots, picture frames, built in mirrors in homes and public bathrooms, our phones, friend's phones, stranger's phones, and the last reflection is seeing other people's facial reactions to us.

That last one has me the most worried at times. Especially when I am not feeling my greatest and I am highly aware of all my flaws. All I want to do is not look people in the eye and do anything I can to draw less attention to myself. (Which truthfully makes me feel worse for not being a social person when I'm in social situations and limiting myself from any good interaction that could take place. I've _slowly_ started to practice being more outgoing even with eczema on my face or severe dryness because I know the people who love me don't care that much at all - they just want me present in that moment with them.)

What about when we have this idea of ourselves and then we look in the mirror and they don't match? This might be the hardest perception to overcome.

If this is you I challenge you to make a list of features or adjectives you would describe yourself and then spend quiet time in front of the mirror until you can imagine those adjectives fitting.

Or maybe find a good song that you love to dance to and dance in front of the mirror.

These self-love exercises are necessary. We do need to love ourselves. 

But we don't need to obsess. Like all things, it is a balance and it takes a lifetime (and maybe not even that) to get it right. 

If all else fails, walk away from the mirror and remind yourself of your best qualities. Do whatever it takes to befriend yourself. Be friends with yourself because that is what it takes to have an integrated mind, and you'll watch yourself do things you didn't think you could or would. You'll find ways you impress yourself. You'll find new ways to enjoy being you and that is a very good and necessary thing to live out our daily life with all its struggles.

And remember, the way you feel about yourself at your absolute best is the way God looks at us every day. Every detail down to every freckle and flaw is not a mistake, but thoughtfully put together by the same painter who made ocean waves and mountains and fire...and in some sense you embody these elements in your abilities and personality. You are whoever you want to be, but above all you are completely and overwhelmingly loved.
