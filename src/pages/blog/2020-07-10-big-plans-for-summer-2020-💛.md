Hi! Welcome to my blog. If we haven't met yet, my name is Rachel Alivia Davis. (It's so *RAD* ðŸ˜‰  lol). I have a small charm/clay/miniature business. Feel free to check me out on Facebook or Instagram at Charms by Rachel Alivia to get an idea of the kind of things that I love to make for people. This post shares a bit more about who I am and some of my goals for the summer. If you'd like a brief version, skip to the bottom where you'll find my list. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this!

Also, I love to meet new people on my social and I'm always willing to take custom orders!

This summer has been rough all around. It's been a strange year filled with sorrow and sadness and tension. Between COVID and the terrible loss our black community members, friends, and family have endured...words can not express the grievances I've felt and I am only a tiny glimpse of what our world and the black community are feeling and has felt for centuries.

I wholly acknowledge that I come from a place of priviledge. I am a young white woman. That alone, is a priviledge. 

One of the wonderful things about starting your own business is you get to decide what sort of things you get passionate about supporting with your time and resources. One of my main missions this summer is to donate 50% or more of one of my products to help support the Black Lives Matter movement. I hope to finish this by mid July and I'll be sharing on my social media when I'm happy with the results. I want to make sure the product is sturdy, beautiful, and shares a message of respect and support before I make them available for purchase. 

Next order of business I have this summer is to continue supporting other artists I find through social media and have had the honor of growing up with. There is one artist in particular which I will leave a link to below so you can check her out - she is incredibly talented, fun, and always leaves me with a big smile. Her name is Daisy Escamilla. She makes gorgeous and adorable digital and watercolor illustrations. I recently commissioned her to paint me a profile picture for my small business and I'm so so excited!

Give her a follow! She is a wonderful person and artist!

Next, I'd like to organize my shop a bit more so my customers can see what all the options are with full clarity. This involves taking more pictures with all the options of displaying my charms such as buying with a necklace chain or buying them as earrings. Fine-tuning the details, as some might say.

Along with this, I want to have some summer sales for summery charms that will make it more affordable for first-time customers to purchase from my shop! I'm hoping succulent charms and other bright and playful summer-themed miniatures and charms will be crowd-pleasers. :)

After I'm finished with this, I'd like to begin making the thing I'm Really excited for because I believe it will brighten up some of our lives during this time while we are mostly still indoors. It can be a buzz kill to have to cancel summer trips or other plans we may have had before COVID lockdown orders were in place. And although, many of these orders are lifting I believe a lot of us are still remaining on the cautious side which is fully understandable and possible! I would like to make.... \*drum roll please\*....

Fun surprise boxes for kids and teens! These would be full of fun activities, charms, gifts, crafts, and more!

Growing up I remember getting these fun "surprise bags" with all sorts of little goodies inside. I loved the idea that you never knew what you were going to get but you had a good idea it would include candy, toys, and maybe some stickers. I am a big fan of receiving fun kawaii gifts and surprises in the mail. 

However, for my idea, I thought it would be really cool to make a list for parents or adults to look over as inspiration or as a guide to what their child might enjoy receiving. These could simply be a loose guideline and everything inside is still a surprise. Or parents could request specific things to include they've seen in my shop that they know their child would enjoy! I imagine it would be a bit different for the teenagers. I'll need to curate separate lists of what most children 10 or younger and teenagers might enjoy!

For example, one of the words from the child's list might include "water" and if the parent includes this word I could include a water-themed sensory box full of floaty toys or some water balloons that they can play with! The options are truly endless!

This project may take the most time curating but I believe the end result will be loads of fun and help families enjoy this summer just a little bit more. I will be making another post soon with a more detailed plan of how this will come together. In the meantime please comment below if you think this is a good idea or have any suggestions for anything! I would love to hear your thoughts! :)



Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you are having a wonderful day.

Much love, 

Rachel Alivia.
