Beauty. 

The quest as old as life.

To find it is to treasure it, to keep it near and close,

To kiss it, to smother it against your face and feel its warmth against your skin.

Beauty.

Is the thing we want to be and the thing we want to be surrounded by.

Beautiful sun sitting upon your shoulders, quaking in the early breath of morning.

Gently unfold the mysterious fabric of this world.

Notice the folds in her face, she only looks dreary but inside her heart is alive and fiery. 

A whisper of smoke trails through the memory, you smell a smell from childhood...why can it never be placed?

Golden drops of sun shimmer on the metallic surfaces, catching everything on fire...

You sit there as the flames rise.

You sit there as the heat begins to build and resurface after a passing cloud.

The restless energy never releases you but you close your eyes and breathe for maybe the first time today. For a brief moment, you depart from yourself and your shoulders finally drop. Your fingers feel as though they're ringing as you allow your body to go limp in the heat of the day.

Everything else can wait.

Everything else must wait.

The sun will rise and fall again, as we are all in search of this.

Productivity is a cruel and manipulative game to play with oneself. When we should be enjoying the moments that carry on to the next.

Why do we spend so much time driving ourselves to do things when we do not have the drive to do them?

Mental health gets left behind. It's the last checkbox on the list, and it's invisible.

So it gets forgotten. Mental health is saddening because it harms those around us as much as ourselves.

I pick at the bumps on my skin, I look for them, I groom myself compulsively.

It's sad. And it's the unfiltered truth. I harm myself and I feel as if I cannot stop. I tell those around me I'm doing it. But there is nothing they can do for me but to tell me no. It's sad. But it's the unfiltered truth.

I am sick of allowing my stress to override all other possibilities. Let this be the day I take control of peace and put it in stress's place.

Let this be the day of beauty.
