These are some of my favorite ideas that I will be using to keep myself entertained: 

\*talk on the phone with loved ones

\*make a scavenger hunt with household family members

\*play or snuggle with pets (or adopt a new one!)

\*read a new book (find wonderful options on Libby and Amazon Prime reading including tons of classics...maybe you can find a book you've always wanted to read but never had the time to until now)

\*start a new TV series, find a good movie, or make a list of things you want to watch and rate them after you watch them

\*deep clean and organize! (I personally have a few junk drawers and closets that could use some attention!)

\*meditate or pray while spending time near a cracked window or in a peaceful place in your home

\*scalp massage - if you find yourself feeling stuffy or experiencing headaches remember to drink plenty of water and try giving yourself a scalp massage! All you need to do is bend over a sink or tub and rinse your scalp with simply water or your choice of soap. Extra points for rubbing a small amount diluted peppermint oil into your scalp for added tingly refreshing sensation.

\*small, simple stretches will get you through the day with sore muscles. I usually feel it worst in my shoulders. I don't know about you but throughout the day if I'm in one position for too long I start to become irritable and lethargic. If you do something as simple as touch your toes (or as close as you can) this will rejuvenate you and help flow the blood back to your head for added focus. Find your favorite go-to stretches and give yourself 5 minutes when you start to see yourself feel this way. This is a great example of practicing mindfulness when you're able to pick up on cues you're uncomfortable or uneasy in any given situation. Be willing to give yourself those short 5 minutes and you will thank yourself for it afterwards.

\*pick up a hobby or art project that you put down a while back or start something new. Some of my favorites include: 

\-clay projects such as making miniatures or charms

\-painting (maybe a piece of furniture or a painting on canvas)

\-writing fictional stories or poetry

\-embroidery on clothes

\-tailor an article of clothing to fit you better

\*trying a new recipe
