  If you have a loved one in your life who is an artist, you might be guilty of
  one of these things. Chances are if you're close to that person they will tell
  you if you have truly offended them or if it is a minor annoyance. 

  No matter how you identify yourself all people like to feel validated and
  respected for their abilities. If you are an artist and you find yourself
  being offended by someone, do a fact check and see if it is worth that energy.
  Otherwise, maybe gently guide the people around you in a different direction.
  Here are some minor annoyances I have come across in my personal experience as
  an artist:

Things people say or ask:

* *"Oh, you're an artist? I am not artistic at all. I can't even draw stick figures."* 

This is just a huge cliche. And not a great talking point. If you have no idea what to talk about with another person of a different interest or occupation consider asking them questions if you are truly interested instead of stating an overused cliche. Plus, if you really want to like your drawings or want skill, maybe ask for tips or advice instead of having a defeatist attitude disguised as a joke. This is my number one pet peeve when I tell other non-artists I am an artist. 

* "What a great hobby!"

This word is a bit demeaning (but all you artists keep in mind the facts of the situation (I say this to myself, too) - depending on the information you give is to the degree people will consider you seriously...meaning if you do not say you *sell* your work or have been an artist all your life they may assume it is just something you do for fun and not a part of you.) If you have mentioned these things and your conversationalist has still somehow talked down your work remind them that it is a job just like any other and takes devotion and focus.

* "But what will you do to be paid?..."

While this is a valid question as a self-made artist (especially in the beginning stages because it is usually extremely challenging financially)...this is just a bit rude. I would recommend this conversation happening only if you feel the two of you are close and open to talking about finances. Be proud of yourself if you are an artist attempting to make a living from your skills and talents. The world needs more of you and you should be fed way more often with inspiring and encouraging words! Be realistic about your means of financial income for stability but achieve as high as you can in your own timing!

* Stating in *any way* that you don't understand how something could be considered art. A great example of devaluing a whole spectrum of artists is stating you don't believe photographers should be considered artists. This is a good way to *not* make friends. The term artist is held for a wide array of people and specialists. Opinionated statements about who a person is in their occupation is disrespectful, period.
* Another cliche such as *"I could make that!"* when looking at a modern or abstract painting...the point is not how "simple" a painting or work of art is, the point is that it is made and if it is so easy, maybe you *should* try it! Whether you like it or not is a completely personal preference. But don't find yourself interesting or unique to state this one over and over again especially when you're with an art friend.
* Assuming being an artist is all fun and games or that it is deemed less significant than another occupation.
* Asking for works of art or personal commission pieces FOR FREE. Keep in mind if an artist gives you a work of art for free, it is best given as a gift without request. If a near perfect stranger requests something without payment, value your time and your skill and request a reasonable pay. Artists, please do not fall trap to this. You do not owe anyone anything "just because you're *so good* at it" or *"I can't afford to pay you right now but..."* No. You deserve pay not only for the cost of materials but for your unique gifts that give you the ability to create the things you do. Value yourself. 
* My last pet peeve is simply when people look a bit dumbfounded. If you have an interest in an artist for any reason or would like to become friends with an artist, try asking more questions to get to know them like *any other person*. Artists are known to be somewhat more introverted, (while this is definitely not always the case), so you might need to lead with an interested question before they tell you about themselves. From experience, I don't like to dive into all the things I love to create out of humility or feeling as if I might overwhelm the person. Whoever you are and wherever you come from you might have a background idea of what it means to be an artist or it might feel like unknown/uninteresting territory but to be a good friend or conversationalist, it is always good to ask and receive questions (have a good back-and-forth like playing catch). Don't blankly stare at the person and let the conversation drop if you hear the words, "I'm an artist." This only sends a clear message, "I am not interested" or "I can not relate."

In conclusion, being an artist comes with its own unique set of pet peeves especially when communicating what your occupation looks like to a non-artist. If this is you, don't be discouraged. It takes a specific kind of mind to enjoy being an artist all your life and you should feel proud for being unique in this way. In this way, we as artists do see things a bit differently and that is a gift! Most of these are not intentional offenses or annoyances. I simply list these as gentle guides for someone who wants to improve their conversations with someone they know or love who is an artist.

As always, feel free to comment with your thoughts in regard to anything mentioned whether you are an artist or something else totally different! You are welcome here whoever you are :) 

Thanks for reading.
