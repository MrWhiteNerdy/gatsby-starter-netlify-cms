  Hello friends! This month, I've taken to an old friend: crocheting. I decided
  to share some of my thoughts with you on how I feel this hobby is seriously
  satisfying and healing.

Were you in band class, choir, or orchestra growing up? Did you ever take piano lessons as a kid? (*Lucky*!) Well, if you said yes to any of these things you probably have had the honor of learning how to read music. It is such a lovely language. 

I'm beginning to see the correlation between reading music and the rhythm of the crocheting. Both have a beautiful flow to the process once you become engaged. I imagine this feels a lot like doing dance steps over and over.

Repetition feels theraputic for me when I'm feeling a bit foggy or not sure of my next step. I wanted to share this because I think it is so wonderful to have a tool to incorporate rhythm into our daily practices. What does the word rhythm mean to me? To me, the word rhythm means doing a particular action or motion over and over and it feels fulfilling. That last part is key. If this action or motion feels unfulfilling then it can feel like you're doing the opposite which is going through the motions. But *rhythm* has soul and heart and purpose behind it.

Rhythm is in the way we cook our favorite meals, it's in the songs we dance to when no one is watching, it's in the kisses we give to our partners and loved ones, it's in a violionist's bow and string movements, in an archer's arrow, in the cat's little wiggle before a pounce, in the stride of a runner's feet to pavement, etc. Rhythm feels good to us because it feels like progression. 

If you are able or willing, I highly recommend trying out crocheting. Depending on the hook and yarn you purchase, it is cheap and affordable and allows you a moment of peace and reflection. I highly encourage you to use cheap or free sources out there for all of us on YouTube for beginners if you're new. Watching someone else always helps me learn. After seeing the stitches and what they are labeled I can then become like a fisherman and grab more fish instead of only being fed one fish. Personally, I've been trying my hand at a lot of different granny square patterns and lace patterns. They have a beautiful pattern to them which feels really good once you grasp how you like to hold the yarn and the hook as you move through the stitch.

Once again, there are many ways to incorporate rhythm but this is one hobby I highly suggest you try. Thanks for reading my thoughts and I hope this inspired you to find the rhythm in your life for healing and enjoyment. 

Much love, 

Rachel
