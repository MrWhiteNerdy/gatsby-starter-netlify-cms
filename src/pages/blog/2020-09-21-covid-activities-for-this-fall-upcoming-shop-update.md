  Hello all and welcome! In this post, I’ll be sharing a list of fun activities
  to try out this fall that meet the orders of staying safe/staying at home. If
  your wish is to try a new hobby or game to past the time, check out some of
  these ideas! This list might also benefit other small art business owners like
  me who are racking their brains for creative products/projects to sell to
  their customers during these unique times in 2020. Much love to everyone who
  reads this and I hope you’re able to find an enjoyable and fun new hobby this
  season!

1. **Craft kits**: embroidery kit, stamp-making kit, watercolor kit, polymer clay kit, and crochet kit

These are a few ideas I have in curating some lovely and cohesive craft kits for my customers. I will drop a small blog post once these are securely set up on my shop, (click the yellow “shop” icon at the top-right if you’re curious what items I already have listed). My hope is to create detailed instructions along with recommended channels or additional resources to check out that would be helpful for creating beautiful works of art. I have some skills in each of these subjects that I would love to pass on to anyone who is looking for a new gratifying artistic endeavor. This fall feels truly perfect to sit back, relax, and become immersed in a new creative pursuit.

2. **Handmade home décor items**: pillows, blankets, wall décor, plant hangers, etc.

These items are a bit more straight-forward. They will be handmade by me and simple to install. I do have a couple of items currently listed such as a hanging planter and wall décor that might interest you.

3. **Cozy Kit/Box of Fall**: This one is along the lines of a craft kit but instead of creating, you will simply unbox and enjoy! This one is a no-fuss sort of gift to yourself or a loved one. I’m imagining selling anything from socks, candles, scarves, candies, tea or coffee, perhaps a deck of affirmation cards, or scented bath salts, and much more! As always, please reach out if you have any additional ideas for me that you think would be wonderful to include! This idea really gives me an exciting feeling to curate because one of my all-time favorite things is putting together thoughtful gifts for my loved ones. When I create a box such as these, I put the same amount of time and care into lovingly creating a gift fit for a friend.
4. **Pet toys!** This item is an idea inspired by my very own kitties. I have two small kittens named Peach and Tiger. I love them dearly and love to see them play with any new toy. As a side interest, I love creating toys out of felt or yarn and I think this would be another simple way of sharing the love with anyone who has recently adopted a new family member! Or maybe you'd like to share some love with your furry friend who you've known for some time! I plan to cozy up with my pets a lot this fall. :) 
5. **More Clay Charm items**: maple leaves, pie charms, pumpkin charms, witches and goblins and ghouls, scary movie-inspired charms, Halloween costume-inspired charms, etc.!

Hopefully, these will generate some good feedback. As always, reach out if you have any additional comments or suggestions. I would love to hear from you! 

If you're new to my shop, you will find mostly find polymer clay charms. This is the main focus of my shop. However, this list of ideas extends to the changing of both times and season and I hope these ideas spark interest and inspiration to others!

Much love and I hope you all have a cozy, creative, and spooky season!
