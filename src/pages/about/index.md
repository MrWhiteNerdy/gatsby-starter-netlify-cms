Hello! My name is Rachel Davis, (my married name makes my initials _RAD_ and I think this is pretty fantastic so I thought I'd add for bragging rights). I am an independent artist based in Kansas City, MO with my wonderful husband. I love to create beautiful things for people and to connect with others. I am currently working on finishing my bachelor's degree. Some of my favorite subjects include art history, health/wellness, and literature. Please feel free to reach out to me anytime with questions or inquiries! And thank you for visiting my site!
