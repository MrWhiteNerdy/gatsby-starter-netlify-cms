Hello! *Welcome, friend* ðŸ’œ  My name is Rachel Davis. I am an artist (that works with primarily polymer clay) and I live in Kansas City, MO with my loving husband and too kitties, Peach & Tiger. 

I love to connect with others through my polymer clay creations and to make things that spread love, kindness, and joy. ðŸ˜˜ ðŸŒºðŸŒ¸ 

I own a small business called Charms by Rachel Alivia. You can check out my shop in the bright yellow link at the top right or find me on Instagram or Facebook. Thank you to everyone who helps me do what I love. It is such a gift to be able to create what you enjoy and have fun in your work. I owe many thanks to anyone who has given me encouragement and support.

I have many art passions but some of my other favorite subjects I enjoy learning about include art history, health & wellness, and literature.

I would be so happy to hear from you! Reach out if you ever feel like chatting or have a question. :)

Thank you for visiting my site!
