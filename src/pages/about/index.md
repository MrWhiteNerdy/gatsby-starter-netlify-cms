Hello and welcome! I am an independent artist based in Kansas City, MO with my wonderful husband. I love to create beautiful things for people and to connect with others. I am currently working on finishing my bachelors degree. Some of my favorite subjects include art history, health & wellness, and literature. Please feel free to reach out to me anytime with questions or inquiries! And thank you for visiting my site!
